    <ol>
      <li>
        <h1>b tag</h1>
        <p>The "b" tag in HTML is used to format text as bold.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>i tag</h1>
        <p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>u tag</h1>
        <p>
          The "u" tag in HTML is used for unarticulated annotations, not just
          underlining text. This means it indicates that the enclosed text has
          some special meaning, but the nature of that meaning isn't directly
          conveyed by the tag itself.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>select tag</h1>
        <p>
          The "select" tag in HTML is used to create a drop-down list, also
          known as a select element. This allows users to choose one or more
          options from a predefined set. It's commonly used within forms to
          collect user input.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>button tag</h1>
        <p>

          webpage. It serves several purposes:
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>hr tag</h1>
        <p>
          The "hr" tag in HTML stands for horizontal rule and is used to
          visually separate content on a webpage. While it often appears as a
          simple horizontal line, its primary purpose is to represent a thematic
          break.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1>br tag</h1>
        <p>The "br" tag in HTML is used to create a line break within text. It's an empty tag, meaning it doesn't have a closing tag like most other HTML elements. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1> anchor tag </h1>
        <p>The anchor tag is used to create links in HTML. It is represented by the <a> tag. The href attribute of the anchor tag specifies the URL of the page or resource to be linked. It can be an absolute URL or a relative URL. For example,  <a href='https://www.google.com'>Click here (Google)</a> </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1> image tag </h1>
        <p>   The img tag in HTML is used to display images on a webpage. It is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not require a closing tag. The img tag has several attributes, including the src attribute which specifies the URL of the image to display. For example:

          Example
          
          <img src='path/to/image.jpg' alt='Description of the image'>
          In the above example, the src attribute specifies the path to the image file, and the alt attribute provides a description of the image for accessibility purposes.  </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h1>self-closing tag </h1>
        <p>  A self-closing tag is an HTML tag that does not require a closing tag. It is used to represent an element that does not have any content within it. Self-closing tags are commonly used for elements like images (img), line breaks (br), input fields (input), and meta tags (meta).

          Example
          
          <img src='path/to/image.jpg'>
          <br>
          <input type='text' name='username'> </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h1> Attributes </h1>
        <p>Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. They are added to the opening tag of an element. Some common attributes include src, alt, width, and height. Attributes can have values that are specified using quotes. Here is an example of an attribute usage:

          Example
          
          <img src='path/to/image.jpg' alt='Description of the image' width='200' height='100'> </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1> input tag </h1>
        <p>The input tag is a versatile element in HTML that is used to create various types of input fields like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. The input tag is a self-closing tag and has a type attribute to specify the type of input field. Here is an example of an input tag for a text field:

          Example
          
          <input type='text' name='username'> </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h1> type attribute </h1>
        <p>  The type attribute is used in the input tag to specify the type of input field to create. It can be used to create different types of input fields like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. The value of the type attribute determines the behavior and appearance of the input field. Here is an example of the type attribute usage:

          Example
          
          <input type='text' name='username'> </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
