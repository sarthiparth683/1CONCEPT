// Concept: Constructor Function in JavaScript
// Introduction
// A constructor function is a special type of function in JavaScript that is used to create and initialize objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating multiple instances of objects with similar properties and methods. Constructor functions are commonly used in object-oriented programming to define and instantiate objects.
// Detailed Explanation
// What is the concept? - A constructor function is a function used to create and initialize objects. It is called with the new keyword to create new instances of objects based on its blueprint.
// Why is it useful? - Constructor functions provide a convenient way to create multiple instances of objects with consistent properties and behaviors. They encapsulate object creation logic and promote code reusability.
// Real-world examples or analogies - Think of a constructor function as a mold in a factory that is used to create multiple copies of a product with the same design.

// Constructor Function Example 1
  function User(name, age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
      this.printHello = function(){
        console.log("Hello...")
      };
      this.printInfo = function(city){
        console.log(`Hi my name is ${this.name} and I am from ${city}`)
      }
  }

  let user1 = new User("Alice", 20);
  let user2 = new User("Bob", 22);

  console.log(user1);
  user1.printHello();
  console.log(user2);
  user2.printInfo("Pune");
  //--------------------------------------------------------------------
//   Constructor Function Example 2

// create a Constructor function Student that copy properties and methods from the User Constructor function and adds an additional property batchno.
function User(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

User.prototype.printHello = function() {
    console.log("Hello...");
};

function Student(name, age, batchno) {
    User.call(this, name, age); // Copy properties from User

    this.batchno = batchno; // Add additional property batchno
}

// copy methods from User
Student.prototype = Object.create(User.prototype);
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

let student1 = new Student("Pavan", 26, "BatchA");
let student2 = new Student("Roshan", 30, "BatchB");

console.log(student1);
student1.printHello(); //  method from User
console.log(student2);

// Task 1:

// You are tasked with creating a constructor function called Animal that represents various animals. The Animal constructor function should have properties to store the number of legs the animal has (noOfLegs) and whether it is vegetarian or not (vegetarian). Additionally, each animal object should have a method called eat and greet which, when called, outputs a message indicating that the animal is eating and displays the number of legs it has.

// Your task is to implement the Animal constructor function according to the given specifications and demonstrate its usage by creating two animal objects using the new keyword. Ensure that the eat method behaves as described.

// Example usage:

  let animal1 = new Animal(4, true);
console.log(animal1);

let animal2 = new Animal(6, false);
console.log(animal2);
animal2.eat(); // eating...

// Solution
function Animal(noOfLegs, vegetarian) {
    this.noOfLegs = noOfLegs;
    this.vegetarian = vegetarian;
    this.eat = function() {
        console.log("eating..", this.noOfLegs);
    };
    this.greet = function(){
    console.log("greetings.." )
  }
}

// Example invocation
let animal1 = new Animal(4, true);
console.log(animal1);

let animal2 = new Animal(6, false);
console.log(animal2);
animal2.eat(); // eating...
animal2.greet();
//----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Task 2:

// You are tasked with creating a constructor function called Bird that represents birds. The Bird constructor function should inherit properties and methods from the Animal constructor function. Additionally, it should have a property called canFly to indicate whether the bird can fly or not.

// Your task is to implement the Bird constructor function according to the given specifications and demonstrate its usage by creating a bird object. Ensure that the Bird object inherits properties and methods from the Animal constructor function and contains the canFly property.

// Solution:

function Animal(noOfLegs, vegetarian) {
   this.noOfLegs = noOfLegs;
   this.vegetarian = vegetarian;
   this.eat = function() {
       console.log("eating..", this.noOfLegs);
   };
   this.greet = function(){
   console.log("greetings.." )
 }
}


 function Bird(noOfLegs, vegetarian, canFly) {
     Animal.call(this, noOfLegs, vegetarian);
     this.canFly = canFly;
 }

 // example invocation
 let b1 = new Bird(2, true, false);
 console.log(b1);

// Conclusion
// The concept of constructor functions in JavaScript, which are functions used to create and initialize objects. We saw how to create a constructor function called Animal to generate objects representing animals with specific properties and methods. This approach simplifies object instantiation and promotes code maintainability. Constructor functions are an essential aspect of object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
