// Student Activities
// Setting and Retrieving Data:
// Task: Write a JavaScript function that allows users to input their name in a text field and store it in local storage when a "Save" button is clicked. Display a message confirming the name has been saved.
// Instructions: Students should create an HTML file with a text input field and a button. They should then write JavaScript code to retrieve the input value when the button is clicked, store it in local storage using the localStorage.setItem() method, and display a confirmation message. Managing Preferences:

// Task: Create a simple web page with two buttons: "Enable Dark Mode" and "Disable Dark Mode". Implement functionality using local storage to toggle between dark and light themes when these buttons are clicked.
// Instructions : Students should write JavaScript code to toggle between dark and light themes by adding or removing a CSS class to the HTML document's body element. They should use local storage to remember the user's preference between page reloads. Shopping Cart Functionality:

// Task: Design a web page with a list of products. Add a "Add to Cart" button for each product. Implement functionality to store the selected products in the user's cart using local storage.
// Instructions: Students should create a product list with multiple items, each having an "Add to Cart" button. When a user clicks the button, the selected product should be stored in local storage as a part of the user's shopping cart. Students should also display the number of items in the cart on the page.

// In conclusion, local storage in web development provides a convenient mechanism for persistently storing data within the user's browser. By leveraging the localStorage API, developers can create seamless user experiences and enhance the functionality of their web applications.
