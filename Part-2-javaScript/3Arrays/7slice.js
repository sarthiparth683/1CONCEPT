// The slice() method extracts a section of an array and returns a new array. It takes two arguments: the start index (inclusive) and the end index (exclusive). It's like cutting out a specific portion from a cake.
let arr1 = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape',"mango","kiwi","melon","Berry"];
let arr2 = arr1.slice(1, 3);
console.log(arr2);
console.log(arr1);
