//   Summary: Classical vs Prototypical Inheritance
// In Classical object-oriented programming, like in java & c++, we have two constructs: classes and objects. Classes act as a blueprint (or a specification or a structure ) and objects are constructed using the structure provided by its Class. Inheritance in classical programming happens at the level of classes. Classes mostly cannot be modified at runtime.

// Javascript internally does not have classes. Prototypical inheritance is all about objects linked to other objects. Instead of defining a structure through a class, In Javascript, you simply create an object. In order to access the properties and methods of another object, we simply need to set up a Proto-typical relationship of our object with that another object. Prototypical chains are very flexible and can be changed at runtime.

// All the inheritance techniques of Javascript like
