        In addition to Prefetch, Temp, and %Temp%, there are other folders and
        system utilities you can access via the Run command in Windows to delete
        unnecessary files and potentially improve system performance: 1. Recent
        Files Run Command: recent This opens a folder containing shortcuts to
        files you've recently accessed. You can delete these shortcuts (not the
        actual files) to clear recent history.

        files, cookies, and history.

      <li>
        4. DNS Cache Run Command: cmd (Opens Command Prompt) In the Command
        Prompt, type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter. This will clear the DNS
        cache, which can help with connectivity issues and speed up DNS

        Editor) You can tweak the Prefetch settings in the registry. Navigate

        packages in Disk Cleanup to remove unused driver packages. These
        methods, when used carefully, can help improve your system's

        always double-check what you are removing, especially when accessing
        advanced features like the Registry Editor.
