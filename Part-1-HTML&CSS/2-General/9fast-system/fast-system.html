      <li>1. C-Drive-properties- Disk Cleanup .</li>
      <li>
        3. Disable Startup Programs - Open Task Manager - Startup tab, and
        disable unnecessary programs from launching at startup.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Defragment Your Hard Drive (For HDDs): If you're using a traditional
        hard drive (not an SSD), defragmentation can help optimize file storage.
        Type Defragment in the Start menu and choose the drive to defragment.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Update Drivers and Windows: Keeping drivers up to date, especially
        for the graphics card and system hardware, can improve performance.
        Ensure Windows is up to date with the latest patches and updates.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. Adjust Power Settings: In Control Panel > Power Options, set the
        power plan to High Performance to allow your PC to use maximum
        performance settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. Disable Visual Effects: For older PCs, disabling animations and
        visual effects can help: Right-click This PC, select Properties, and go
        to Advanced system settings. Under the Performance section, click
        Settings and select Adjust for best performance (or customize it by
        turning off specific visual effects).
      </li>
      <li>
        8. Free Up Space by Clearing System Restore Points: You can remove all
        but the most recent system restore points: Go to Control Panel > System
        > System Protection, click Configure, and select Delete to remove older
        restore points.
      </li>
      <li>
        9. Disable Search Indexing (if performance is slow during searches):
        Type Services in the Start menu, scroll down to Windows Search,
        right-click it, and select Properties. Set it to Disabled to stop
        Windows from indexing files.
      </li>
      <li>
        10. Clean Up Your Browser: Clear your browser's cache and cookies, and
        consider using fewer extensions. Browser-related bloat can slow down
        overall performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        11. Use an SSD: If your system still uses an HDD, upgrading to an SSD
        will dramatically improve boot times and overall responsiveness.
      </li>
      <li>
        12. Check for Malware and Viruses: Run a full system scan using your
        antivirus software or a specialized tool like Malwarebytes to ensure
        your system isn't slowed by malicious software.
      </li>
      <li>
        13. Disable Background Apps: Go to Settings > Privacy > Background apps
        and turn off apps that run in the background unnecessarily.
      </li>
      <li>
        14. Increase Virtual Memory (Pagefile): Increasing the size of your
        virtual memory can help with performance when running many applications:
        Right-click This PC, go to Properties > Advanced system settings, under
        the Performance section click Settings > Advanced > Virtual memory, and
        adjust it manually. These steps combined can lead to noticeable
        improvements in speed and responsiveness on your PC.
      </li>
      <li>
        In addition to Prefetch, Temp, and %Temp%, there are other folders and
        system utilities you can access via the Run command in Windows to delete
        unnecessary files and potentially improve system performance: 1. Recent
        Files Run Command: recent This opens a folder containing shortcuts to
        files you've recently accessed. You can delete these shortcuts (not the
        actual files) to clear recent history.
      </li>

      <li>
        2. Recycle Bin Run Command: shell:RecycleBinFolder This opens the
        Recycle Bin. Empty it to free up disk space.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Temporary Internet Files (Internet Cache) Run Command: inetcpl.cpl
        This opens the Internet Properties window. Under the General tab, click
        Delete in the Browsing history section to clear your temporary internet
        files, cookies, and history.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. DNS Cache Run Command: cmd (Opens Command Prompt) In the Command
        Prompt, type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter. This will clear the DNS
        cache, which can help with connectivity issues and speed up DNS
        resolution.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. System Restore Points Run Command: sysdm.cpl (Opens System
        Properties) Go to the System Protection tab, click Configure on your
        system drive, then click Delete to remove all system restore points
        except the most recent one.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. DirectX Shader Cache Run Command: cleanmgr (Opens Disk Cleanup)
        Select your system drive (C:), and check the DirectX Shader Cache
        option. This will remove old DirectX cache files.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. Downloaded Program Files Run Command: cleanmgr In the Disk Cleanup
        window, select Downloaded Program Files (ActiveX controls and Java
        applets that are cached from the internet).

      <li>
        10. Hibernate File Run Command: cmd (Opens Command Prompt) Type powercfg
        -h off and press Enter. This will disable hibernation and delete the
        hiberfil.sys file, which can take up a significant amount of disk space.
      </li>
      <li>
        11. Prefetch Advanced Option Run Command: regedit (Opens Registry
        Editor) You can tweak the Prefetch settings in the registry. Navigate
        to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
        Manager\Memory Management\PrefetchParameters Modify the EnablePrefetcher
        value: 0: Disable Prefetch 1: Prefetch only for application startup 2:
        Prefetch only for boot 3: Prefetch for both application and boot
        (default)
      </li>
      <li>
        12. Driver Store Cleanup Run Command: cleanmgr Check Device driver
        packages in Disk Cleanup to remove unused driver packages. These
        methods, when used carefully, can help improve your system's
        performance. Be sure not to delete any essential system files, and
        always double-check what you are removing, especially when accessing
        advanced features like the Registry Editor.
