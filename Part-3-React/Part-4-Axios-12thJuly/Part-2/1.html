        Batch Updates in React
Introduction
React enhances application performance by batching state updates. This means that when you invoke a state setter function, such as setCount, React doesn't immediately cause the component to re-render. Instead, it schedules the update and later performs all the state updates together in a single batch. This behavior is particularly observable in event handlers or lifecycle methods, contributing significantly to efficiency and performance optimization.

Detailed Explanation
React's batching of state updates is a mechanism designed to aggregate multiple state changes into a single update cycle. This process allows React to minimize the number of re-renders required, thereby optimizing the performance of React applications. When multiple state setter functions are called, instead of updating the state and re-rendering the component after each call, React waits and updates the component once with all the changes. This approach is not only efficient but also ensures consistency across state updates.
