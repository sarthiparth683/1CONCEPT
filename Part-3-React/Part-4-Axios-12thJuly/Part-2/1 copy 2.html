  let [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  let handleIncrement = () => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);

      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>+</button>
      Why console.log Shows the Previous Value
When you call setCount(count + 1), React schedules an update to the state but doesn't execute it immediately. The console.log statement right after setCount is still part of the current render cycle, and thus, it accesses the current value of count, which hasn't been updated yet.

Understanding Asynchronous Nature
This behavior illustrates the asynchronous nature of state updates in React. The actual state change happens asynchronously outside the current scope of execution. Therefore, logging the state variable immediately after calling its setter function won't reflect the new value.
Functional form of the setter function ensures that each update is based on the most recent state value

When you need to update a state variable based on its previous value, the functional form ensures that you're working with the most recent state. This is especially important in scenarios where state updates might be batched, such as in event handlers or when multiple state updates are grouped together.

Student activities
Modify the App component to include a decrement button that decreases the count.
Explore how React batches updates by creating a component that updates two different state variables in various ways (e.g., using both the direct and functional forms of the setter function) and observing the behavior.
Conclusion
Batch updates in React refer to the mechanism where multiple setState calls within the same component are batched together for efficiency.
React internally batches state updates triggered by useState, resulting in improved performance by minimizing re-renders.
This batching behavior ensures that multiple state updates in a single component only trigger a single re-render cycle.
Understanding how React batches state updates with useState is crucial for optimizing performance in React applications.
Developers should leverage useState's batch update mechanism to minimize unnecessary re-renders and enhance application performance.
