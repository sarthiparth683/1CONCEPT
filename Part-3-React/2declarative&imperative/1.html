    <p>Declarative Vs Imperative Programming
        Introduction
        In the realm of web development, understanding the concepts of declarative and imperative programming is crucial for designing interactive and dynamic web applications. This lesson explores these programming paradigms, focusing on their application in creating web interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
        
        Detailed Explanation
        Imperative Programming
        Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on describing how a program operates. It involves writing code that outlines a series of steps to achieve a specific goal. This approach is characterized by explicit commands that change the program's state step by step.
        
        Example: When using JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), developers explicitly instruct the browser on how to create, modify, and interact with web page elements. This method requires a detailed sequence of operations, making it clear how the application's state changes over time.
        
        Declarative Programming
        Contrary to imperative programming, declarative programming emphasizes what the desired outcome is, rather than how to achieve it. This paradigm abstracts the logic of state changes or element manipulation, allowing developers to express their intentions without detailing the control flow or state management.
        
        Example: React, a JavaScript library, embodies the declarative paradigm by enabling developers to describe the UI state and letting React handle the actual rendering and state updates. This approach simplifies code and enhances readability and maintainability.
        
        Comparing Paradigms with HTML and CSS
        HTML is inherently declarative, as it describes the structure of web pages without specifying the steps to render them.
        CSS further exemplifies declarative programming by defining the appearance of web elements without detailing the rendering process.</p>

//     Introduction to React and ReactDOM

// expand_less
// React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components". ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app in order to interact with the DOM.

// Example

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
