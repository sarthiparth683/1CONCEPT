<!-- Event Handling in react
Introduction
This lesson covers one of the essential concepts in React development: event handling. Understanding these concepts is crucial for creating interactive and dynamic web applications with React.
Detailed Explanation
Event Handling in React
Event handling in React allows components to respond to user inputs and actions, such as clicks, typing, or mouse movements. React abstracts the process of handling events to offer a seamless way to react to user interactions within the virtual DOM using JSX syntax.
How It Works
Events in React are named using camelCase rather than lowercase.
Event handlers are passed as functions rather than strings.
Example
Consider a simple application with a button and an input field. The button has an onClick event that triggers an alert, and the input field has an onChange event that logs changes to the console. -->
