<!-- State Management :
Introduction :
State: In React, state refers to data or properties that need to be tracked across re-renders. It is an value that represents the current state of the component.
Detailed Explanation
To understand why we need to understand state management, let's consider the following scenario:
The Challenge
Consider a counter application where clicking a button increments a count displayed on the UI. We are trying to maintain a variable called count which will be displayed onto UI. Clicking on the button should increase the value of count and this updated value should be reflected onto DOM
Code Implementation | Examples
Approach 1 and the problem with this :
When the App component first renders, count is set to 0. The UI shows "You clicked 0 times".
When you click the button, handleClick is called. It increments count and logs the new value. However, the UI still shows "You clicked 0 times".
Expectation vs. Reality :
As a developer, you might expect that changing count would update the UI. However, these changes are not being reflected.
Why Doesn't the UI Update ?
A simple answer - REACT doesnâ€™t know. React has no way of knowing that count has changed and that it needs to update the UI. -->
