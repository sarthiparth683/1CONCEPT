<!-- Sibling to Sibling : Sharing some information between sibling components
Now, imagine the Parent has more than one Child â€“ they are siblings. If these siblings need to share information, they can't do it directly. Instead, they ask the Parent to be the messenger. The Parent holds the information and passes it to each Child as needed.

Example :

There are three siblings:

Child1 shows the count
Child2 has a button to increase the count
Child3 tells if the count is an odd or even number.
The Parent keeps the count and shares it with all three children.

 <!-- Conclusion
Data sharing between components is vital for cohesive and interactive React applications.
Effective communication mechanisms include props, context, and state upliftment.
These techniques enable passing data from parent to child components or sharing between sibling components.
Understanding and implementing these methods allows developers to establish robust data sharing strategies.
Proper data sharing enhances code modularity and facilitates the creation of scalable React applications. -->
