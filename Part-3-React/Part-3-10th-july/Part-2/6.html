<!-- State upliftment
Introduction
State upliftment in React involves lifting state from child to parent components to share data across the application efficiently. By moving state higher up the component tree, it becomes accessible to multiple components that need it. This pattern promotes better data flow and reduces prop drilling, where props are passed down through multiple layers. In this introduction, we'll explore the concept of state upliftment in React and its benefits for creating more scalable and maintainable applications.

Detailed Explanation
Independent component states
Consider a scenario where you have a button component in React. Each time this component is used, it maintains its own state.

When you use this MyButton component multiple times in your App like this. Each button keeps track of its own clicks independently. That means if you click one button, it updates its count without affecting the other. -->
