<!-- Data sharing between components - Broad Picture
Introduction
In React applications, efficient data sharing between components is essential for creating cohesive and interactive user interfaces. Whether passing data from parent to child components or sharing data between sibling components, establishing effective communication mechanisms is crucial. Through props, context, or state upliftment, React provides various methods for seamlessly sharing data across components. In this introduction, we'll explore these techniques and their respective advantages, enabling developers to implement robust data sharing strategies in their React applications.
Detailed explanation
Let us try and understand how data can be shared between components in React Application.
Data / Info can be passed from
Parent to Child
Child to Parent
Sibling to Sibling
Code Implementation | Examples
Parent to Child : Sending some information from parent to child
03 (2)
The Parent holds some information, like a number, in its personal box called 'state'. Whenever the Parent wants to share this information with the Child, it sends it over as a 'prop' (short for property). The Child can use this prop to display the information, but it can't change what's inside the prop. It's like receiving a letter that you can read but not edit.
Imagine you have a "Parent" component and a "Child" component. The Parent is like a generous giver, and the Child is the receiver.
Example :
You have a Parent that keeps track of a number ( count ). The Parent saves this count and also passes it to the Child. The Child then displays this number.
Here's a code example to visualize this: -->

            <Child count={count} />
            <button onClick={increment}>Click Me</button>
          </div>
        );
      }
      const reactRoot = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      reactRoot.render(<Parent />);
