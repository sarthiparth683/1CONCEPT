<!-- State Management in React: Understanding the useState Hook
Introduction
Modern user interfaces are interactive and responsive to user actions, such as clicking a button or entering text. In React, managing this interactivity hinges on the concept of "state." State refers to the data that changes over time within your application. To handle state effectively, React introduces a feature known as "hooks," with the useState hook being the primary tool for adding state to function components. This lesson will explore the useState hook, demonstrating its importance and usage in building responsive applications.
Detailed Explanation
What is the useState Hook?
useState is a built-in hook in React that allows function components to have their own state. It enables the initialization of a state variable and provides a function to update this state. When the state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the update. This mechanism is fundamental for creating dynamic and interactive applications.
Advantages of Using useState
Simplicity: Simplifies the state management in functional components, making code more readable and maintainable.
Reusability: Enables the use of state logic across multiple components, promoting code reuse.
Optimization: React optimizes for performance, ensuring minimal re-renders and efficient updates.

            <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>

This example highlights several key aspects of the useState hook:
Initialization: The useState hook initializes the state variable count with a value of 0.
Updating State: The setCount function is used to update the state of count, triggering a re-render.
Destructuring: The returned pair from useState is destructured into count and setCount, making the code cleaner and more intuitive. -->
