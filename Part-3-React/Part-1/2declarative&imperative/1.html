        Imperative Programming Imperative programming is a programming paradigm
        that focuses on describing how a program operates. It involves writing
        code that outlines a series of steps to achieve a specific goal. This
        approach is characterized by explicit commands that change the program's
        state step by step.

        Declarative Programming Contrary to imperative programming, declarative
        programming emphasizes what the desired outcome is, rather than how to
        achieve it. This paradigm abstracts the logic of state changes or
        element manipulation, allowing developers to express their intentions
        without detailing the control flow or state management.

        Comparing Paradigms with HTML and CSS HTML is inherently declarative, as
        it describes the structure of web pages without specifying the steps to
        render them. CSS further exemplifies declarative programming by defining
        the appearance of web elements without detailing the rendering process.

        React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for
        building user interfaces.
