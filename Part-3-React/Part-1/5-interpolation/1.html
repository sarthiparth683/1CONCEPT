<!-- More about JSX: Interpolation, Props, Attributes, Events, and More
In this lesson, we will delve deeper into JSX, exploring its capabilities such as interpolation, properties (props), attributes, self-closing tags, event handling, the spread operator, fragments, and inline styling. These features enhance the dynamic and expressive power of JSX, making it a core part of React development.

Introduction
JSX stands as a syntactic extension for JavaScript, provided by React to describe the UI structure with a syntax similar to HTML. Its integration within JavaScript brings a powerful template engine that allows for dynamic content rendering, event handling, and component properties management with ease.

Detailed Explanation
Properties and Attributes in JSX
Just like in HTML, JSX allows the addition of properties and attributes to elements, enhancing their functionality and presentation. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      //   Just like in HTML, JSX allows the addition of properties and attributes to elements, enhancing their functionality and presentation.
      const element = (
        <p id="quote" className="message">
          Carpe Diem
        </p>
      );

      //   This JSX code is transpiled into a JavaScript call that your browser can understand:
      const element2 = React.createElement(
        "p",
        { id: "quote", className: "message" },
        "Carpe Diem"
      );

      //       Interpolation
      // Interpolation in JSX enables embedding JavaScript expressions within the JSX markup, allowing dynamic content updates.
      const myText = "Carpe Diem";
      const element3 = <div>{myText}</div>;
      // This gets converted to:
      const element4 = React.createElement("div", null, myText);

      // Self-Closing Tags
      // JSX supports self-closing tags, similar to HTML, making it convenient for defining elements without children, such as img.

      const element5 = (
        <img src="https://placehold.co/400" alt="some placeholder image" />
      );

      // Event Handlers
      // JSX simplifies event handling by allowing you to embed event handlers directly within the markup.
      const alertFunc = () => {
        alert("Button Clicked!");
      };
      const element6 = <button onClick={alertFunc}>Click Me</button>;


//       Properties/Attributes and the Spread Operator
// The spread operator {...} can be used to pass a whole object of properties to a JSX element, streamlining the code.

const props = { className: "button", id: "click-button", onClick: alertFunc };
const element7 = <button {...props}>Click Me</button>;


// Rendering Multiple Elements
// JSX requires elements to be wrapped in a single parent element or a fragment to be rendered properly.

const element8 = (
  <React.Fragment>
    <span>Carpe</span>
    <span>Diem</span>
  </React.Fragment>
);


// Inline Styling
// Inline styling in JSX is achieved by passing a style object to the style attribute of an element.

const element9 = (
  <div
    style={{
      margin: "20px",
      padding: "20px",
      border: "1px solid cyan",
      color: "darkcyan",
      backgroundColor: "lightcyan",
    }}
  >
    Here is a box with styling done using inline styling
  </div>
);


// Code Implementation | Examples
// Let's implement a React element as specified:

const ReactFragmentExample = () => (
  <React.Fragment>
    <p>React is a javascript library</p>
    <div className="main">
      <p>Click the below button to alert Hello</p>
      <button onClick={() => alert("Hello")}>Alert Hello</button>
    </div>
  </React.Fragment>
);

// Conclusion
// JSX offers a powerful syntax for defining UI components in React, blending the expressiveness of HTML with the dynamism of JavaScript. Understanding how to use interpolation, props, attributes, event handlers, and more can significantly enhance your React development skills.


// Components and Props

// expand_less
// Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. Props are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes.

// Example

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element11 = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);






// Handling Events

// expand_less
// Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. However, there are some syntax differences: React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.

// Example

function ActionLink() {
  function handleClick(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('The link was clicked.');
  }

  return (
    <a href="#" onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </a>
  );
}



// State and Lifecycle

// expand_less
// State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component. React components can have state by setting this.state in their constructors. React components can also use state to let React know that the componentâ€™s state has changed, and this could trigger a UI update.

// Example

class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}










// Interpolation in JSX

// expand_less
// Interpolation in JSX allows you to embed expressions in JSX. Minimum {}; you can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX.

// Example

function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element12 = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {format(canvasRenderingCcontext2dName(user))}!
  </h1>
);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
