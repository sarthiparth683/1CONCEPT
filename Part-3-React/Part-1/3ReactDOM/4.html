    <title>Create UI With React API</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Why React?
        React simplifies the creation of complex and interactive UIs by abstracting direct DOM manipulations:
        
        Performance: Direct DOM manipulation is slow. React optimizes this process through a virtual DOM, making UI updates more efficient.
        Declarative: React allows developers to describe their UIs in terms of state, making the code more readable and easier to debug.
        Key Differences:
        DOM Elements vs. React Elements: document.createElement directly interacts with the DOM, whereas React.createElement creates lightweight descriptions of UI components, which React then renders into the DOM.
        Direct vs. Indirect Manipulation: Vanilla JS requires manual management of DOM elements and their states. React, through its virtual DOM system, automates this process, allowing for a more declarative UI definition.
        Code Implementation | Examples
        Task: Create and Display a <p> Element Using React and ReactDOM
        Objective:
        Create a <p> element with the text "Seize the day" and display it in the DOM using React and ReactDOM.</p>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script>
      const element = React.createElement("p", {
        children: "Seize the day",
      });
      const reactRoot = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      reactRoot.render(element);
    </script>

    <p>Conclusion
        Through this comparison between JS and DOM manipulation versus using React and ReactDOM, it's clear that React offers a more efficient, declarative approach to building user interfaces. React abstracts away the direct manipulation of the DOM, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code and better performance.</p>
