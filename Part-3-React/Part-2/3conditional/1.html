<!-- Introduction
Conditional Rendering and Conditional Styling are two powerful concepts in React that enhance the dynamic capabilities of your application. They allow for more interactive and responsive user interfaces by adjusting what's displayed and how it's styled based on certain conditions or user interactions.

Detailed Explanation
Conditional Rendering
Conditional Rendering in React involves displaying content or components based on certain conditions. This technique is useful for creating more dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It leverages JavaScript's logical operators such as if statements, ternary operators, and logical && operators to determine which elements should be rendered.

For example, a LightBulb component might display "Bulb is on" or "Bulb is off" based on a boolean prop. Here are two approaches to achieve this:

Using if-else Statements:

        } else {
          return <div>Bulb is off</div>;
        }
      }
      // Using Ternary Operators:
      function LightBulb2(props) {
        return <div>Bulb is {props.on ? "on" : "off"}</div>;
      }
      // Conditional Styling
      // Conditional Styling refers to dynamically changing the style of components based on certain conditions. This can include changing colors, fonts, layouts, and more, in response to user actions or application state.
      // For instance, you might want to change the background color of a LightBulb component depending on whether it's on or off:
      function LightBulb3(props) {
        const styleObject = {
          backgroundColor: props.on ? "yellow" : "grey",
          color: props.on ? "white" : "black",
          padding: "20px",
          border: `1px solid black`,
        };
        return <div style={styleObject}>Bulb is {props.on ? "on" : "off"}</div>;
      }
      function App() {
        return (
          <>
            <LightBulb1 />
            <LightBulb2 />
            <LightBulb3 />
          </>
        );
      }

      // const element = (
      //     <App />
      // );
      const reactRoot = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      reactRoot.render( <App />);
    </script>
