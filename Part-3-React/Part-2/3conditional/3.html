<!-- How React Updates the DOM Efficiently: Understanding the Virtual DOM 
Introduction
In modern web development, the efficiency of updating the Document Object Model (DOM) is crucial for creating fast and responsive applications. React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, introduces an efficient approach to update the DOM through the concept of the Virtual DOM. This lesson explores the Virtual DOM mechanism and its advantages over direct DOM manipulation techniques, such as those used in vanilla JavaScript.

Detailed Explanation
What is the Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM is a programming concept implemented by React and other modern frameworks to improve the performance of web applications. It is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM in the browser, serving as a staging area for changes before they are rendered on the screen.

How Does React Use the Virtual DOM?
React uses the Virtual DOM to optimize updates to the web page in a few steps:

Update: When a component's state changes, React first updates the Virtual DOM.
Diffing: React then compares the updated Virtual DOM with a pre-update version to identify changes.
Reconciliation: Finally, React updates the actual DOM with only the changes identified in the previous step, rather than re-rendering the entire DOM.
Example: Building a Digital Clock
To illustrate the efficiency of React's DOM update mechanism, consider building a digital clock application with both vanilla JavaScript and React.

Clock Built with Vanilla JavaScript
In the vanilla JavaScript version, the entire HTML content within the rootElement is replaced every second, regardless of the extent of changes. This approach is inefficient and can disrupt user interactions, such as typing in an input field, because the input loses focus on each update.

Clock Built with React
In contrast, the React version updates only the necessary parts of the DOM. For instance, it only changes the time string without re-rendering the entire clock component. This targeted update mechanism preserves user interactions, like maintaining focus on an input field.

Code Implementation | Examples
The following code snippets demonstrate the implementation of the digital clock application in both vanilla JavaScript and React: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Clock with JS / DOM</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script>
      let rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
      function tick() {
        const time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
        rootElement.innerHTML = `
                <h1>Digital Clock With vanilla javascript</h1>
                <input type="text" value="focus on this input" />
                <h2>${time}</h2>
            `;
      }
      setInterval(tick, 1000);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
