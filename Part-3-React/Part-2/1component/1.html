<!-- Component and Props
Introduction
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, emphasizing the creation of reusable and combinable UI units known as components. These components are the building blocks of React applications, allowing developers to encapsulate UI logic and presentation. Props, short for properties, play a crucial role in this architecture by enabling components to receive data, enhancing their reusability and flexibility.

Detailed Explanation
Components
A React component is essentially a JavaScript function that returns React elements, facilitating the development of complex UIs from simple, reusable pieces. Components can range from basic UI elements, like buttons and text, to entire application pages. They are defined either as JavaScript functions or classes and are distinguished by their ability to return JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript), which describes the UI structure.

For instance, consider the task of creating a birthday card element with a "Happy Birthday" message. Traditionally, this might involve directly writing repetitive HTML. However, React's component-based approach allows for a more modular and maintainable solution:

Traditional Method: Directly writing the message multiple times. -->

    <h1>Create UI with React API-2</h1>

    <script type="text/babel">
      const element = (
        <>
          <h3>Traditional Method</h3>
          <p>Happy Birthday!-1</p>
          <p>Happy Birthday!-2</p>
        </>
      );
      const reactRoot = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      reactRoot.render(element);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
